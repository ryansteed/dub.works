<p>This innovative bicycle drivetrain, known as DrivEn, won the 2018 Eurobike Innovation Award at the Eurobike show in Germany. Bike manufacturer CeramicSpeed partnered with the University of Colorado’s department of mechanical engineering to introduce an innovative chainless bicycle drivetrain concept. According to Jason Smith, CeramicSpeed’s chief technology officer, “Advancements in drivetrain technology have been evolutionary since the 1920s. DrivEn is truly revolutionary given its unique rolling element power transfer and unmatched efficiency. The DrivEn concept has the ability to change the way the cycling industry views drivetrain design and drivetrain efficiency.”

<p>Some of the features of the DrivEn prototype include: low-friction CeramicSpeed bearings that transfer torque effortlessly from the front ring through the driveshaft to the rear cog; 49 percent less friction than the high-end chain-and-derailleur setups; and DrivEn bikes have less drag, less weight, and take up less space than traditional chain driven bicycles.

<p>Smith further said, “CeramicSpeed has proudly accomplished what many have said couldn’t be done. We achieved a 99 percent-efficient multispeed drivetrain while eliminating the chain and complex rear derailleur.”</p>
